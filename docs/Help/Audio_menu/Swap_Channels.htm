<h3>Swap Channels</h3>

<p>This command exchanges a pair of channels in a multi-channel audio file. For stereo audio, the left and right channels are swapped. For audio with more than two channels, the Swap Channels dialog is displayed, which lets you choose the pair of channels to be swapped. If a <a href="../Navigation/Selecting_audio.htm">selection</a> exists, the channels are swapped within the selection only, otherwise they're swapped throughout the entire document.
