<h3>Peak Statistics</h3>

<p>This command displays peak statistics for the <a href="../Navigation/Selecting_audio.htm">selected audio</a>, or if no selection exists, for the entire document. The statistics include the minimum and maximum samples, the peak level in decibels, and the DC bias. Separate statistics are kept for each channel.

<p>To locate a minimum or maximum sample in the audio, right-click the value of interest, and select <span class="cmd">Go to</span> on the resulting context menu. This moves the <a href="../Navigation/Audio_cursor.htm">audio cursor</a> to the first matching sample. Note that when you right-click, both the row and the column matter: the row specifies which channel to search, and the column (Min Sample or Max Sample) specifies which extreme to locate.
