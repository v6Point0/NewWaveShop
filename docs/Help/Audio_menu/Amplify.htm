<h3>Amplify</h3>

<p>This command boosts or attenuates audio, i.e. makes it louder or quieter. If a <a href="../Navigation/Selecting_audio.htm">selection</a> exists, only the selection is amplified, otherwise the entire document is amplified. The command displays the Amplify dialog, which lets you specify the desired gain in decibels. Enter a positive gain for boost, or a negative gain for attenuation. To see what the new peak level would be, press the <span class="key">Tab</span> key. To do the amplify, click OK or press <span class="key">Enter</span>. If you're boosting enough so that the audio would be clipped, an orange CLIP indicator appears, and a warning message is displayed.
