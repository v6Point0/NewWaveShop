<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This command lets you change the format of an audio file, including its number of channels, sample rate, and sample size. If the channel count is increased, empty channels are appended; if it's decreased, channels are removed at the end. To insert non-empty channels, or delete specific channels, use <a href="../Audio_menu/Insert_Channel.htm">Insert Channel</a> or <a href="../Audio_menu/Delete_Channel.htm">Delete Channel</a> respectively. Note that the audio is NOT resampled, hence changing the sample rate causes the audio to play at a different pitch. To avoid this, use the <a href="../Audio_menu/Resample.htm">resample</a> command instead. Changing the sample size simply shifts the samples left or right as needed; consequently, increasing the sample size (e.g. from 16-bit to 24-bit) is lossless.
