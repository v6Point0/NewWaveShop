<h3>Extract</h3>

<p>This command separates the channels of a multi-channel audio file, by writing each channel to its own mono file. A folder dialog is displayed, allowing you to choose a destination folder for the output files. Each of the resulting files will have the same name as the original document, but with the channel number and name appended to it. To do the opposite, i.e. combine multiple channel files into a single multi-channel file, use <a href="../Audio_menu/Insert_Channel.htm">Insert Channel</a>.
