<h3>Hot keys</h3>

<p>This option lets you assign global (system-wide) hot keys to start and stop <a href="../../Transport_menu/Record.htm">recording</a>. Hot keys are intended for use with the "One-touch" record <a href="../../Options/Record/Activation.htm">activation</a> type. They're supported for other activation types, but probably won't be as useful. Note that WaveShop must be running to detect hot keys, though it can be minimized, and needn't be the foreground task.

<p>To assign a hot key, first use the drop-list to select the target function ("Start" or "Stop"). Then focus the hot key control (to the right of the drop-list), by either left-clicking it, or pressing <span class="key">Tab</span>. Now enter the desired key combination, and then move the focus elsewhere, by left-clicking a different control, or pressing <span class="key">Tab</span> again. To delete an existing hot key assignment, press <span class="key">Delete</span> or <span class="key">Backspace</span> in the hot key control.

<p>Hot key definitions must include at least one modifier key, i.e. <span class="key">Ctrl</span>, <span class="key">Shift</span>, or <span class="key">Alt</span>. Multiple modifier keys (e.g. <span class="key">Ctrl+Shift</span>) are permitted and strongly encouraged. Unmodified hot keys, and hot keys modified only by <span class="key">Alt</span> are disallowed, to avoid conflicting with menus. Choose your hot keys carefully to avoid overriding WaveShop's <a href="../../Loose_ends/Shortcuts.htm">shortcuts</a>, and/or the shortcuts of other applications.
