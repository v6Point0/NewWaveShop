<h3>Meter clip threshold</h3>

<p>This option sets the sensitivity of clip detection in level meters, which appear in the <a href="../../View_menu/Meter_bar.htm">meter bar</a> and <a href="../../Transport_menu/Record.htm">Record</a> dialog. If a clip is detected on a given audio channel, that channel's clip indicator is set; the indication consists of a red rectangle behind the abbreviated channel name, which appears above the level meter. To reset a clip indicator, left-click it. To reset all clip indicators at once, Alt+left-click anywhere within the meter view.

<p>The threshold is expressed in samples, and specifies the minimum number of consecutive samples that must be "on the rails" to be considered <a href="../../Audio_menu/Find_Clipping.htm">clipping</a>. Note that a clip indication doesn't guarantee that peaks were truncated, it just means it's likely, particularly if the threshold is large. To disable meter clip detection, set the threshold to a huge number.
