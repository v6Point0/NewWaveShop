<h3>Averaging</h3>

<p>This option determines how many windows of audio are analyzed for each plot update in the <a href="../../View_menu/Spectrum_bar.htm">spectrum bar</a>. If averaging is zero, only one window is analyzed per update and averaging is effectively disabled; this maximizes responsiveness, but at the cost of jerkiness. If averaging is one, two windows (overlapped by 50%) are analyzed per update, resulting in a slightly smoother plot, for a small cost in terms of increased latency. Bigger averaging values make the plot smoother, but less temporally accurate.

<p>Averaging interacts with <a href="../../Options/Spectrum/Window_size.htm">window size</a> to determine responsiveness. Even with averaging disabled, smaller window sizes still give better responsiveness (and worse spectral resolution) than larger ones. Note that a large averaging value combined with a large window size can cause excessive CPU overhead, particularly if a filled <a href="../../Options/Spectrum/Plot_style.htm">plot style</a> is selected.
