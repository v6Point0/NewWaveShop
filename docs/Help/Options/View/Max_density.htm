<h3>Max density</h3>

<p>This advanced option sets the maximum number of samples that will be computed per pixel when displaying audio. It lets you adjust the tradeoff between visual accuracy and speed. Increasing this value makes the view denser (and more accurate) when <a href="../../Navigation/Zooming_time.htm">zoomed out</a>, at the cost of reduced performance. Setting this value too low causes the view to appear sparse when zoomed out; setting it too high makes the user interface sluggish, particularly while zooming out or scrolling. The default is optimal for most situations. The further in you zoom, the less effect this option has.
