<h3>Selecting audio</h3>

<p>The selection determines what portion of the audio is affected by a subsequent command. Audio can be selected via the mouse, <a href="../View_menu/Navigation_bar.htm">navigation bar</a>, menus, or keyboard <a href="../Loose_ends/Shortcuts.htm">shortcuts</a>. Note that <a href="../Edit_menu/Find_Zero_Crossing.htm">Find Zero Crossing</a> moves the selection start and end to the nearest zero crossing, so it's not necessary to do this manually.

<dt>Selecting via mouse

The drag direction can be either left-to-right or right-to-left. During dragging, the mouse cursor changes to a double-pointed horizontal arrow.
<dt>Adjusting a selection via mouse
