<h3>Scrolling</h3>

<p>If the audio is sufficiently time-zoomed so that it doesn't fit in the window, a horizontal scroll bar appears in the view. To scroll the view, drag the scrollbar thumb, left-click in the scroll bar, or use the mouse wheel. The usual scrolling shortcuts also apply, as listed below. Note that scrolling doesn't move the <a href="../Navigation/Audio_cursor.htm">audio cursor</a>.

<ul>
<li><span class="key">Home</span> scrolls to the beginning of the document.
<li><span class="key">End</span> scrolls to the end of the document.
<li><span class="key">Page Down</span> scrolls forward a page at a time.
<li><span class="key">Page Up</span> scrolls backward a page at a time.
<li><span class="key">Down</span> and <span class="key">Right</span> scroll forward a line at a time.
<li><span class="key">Up</span> and <span class="key">Left</span> scroll backward a line at a time.
<li><span class="cmd">Edit/Goto/Cursor</span> or pressing <span class="key">Ctrl+\</span> scrolls as needed to make the audio cursor visible.
<li><span class="cmd">Edit/Goto/Selection Start</span> or pressing <span class="key">Ctrl+[</span> scrolls as needed to make the <a href="../Navigation/Selecting_audio.htm">selection</a> start visible.
<li><span class="cmd">Edit/Goto/Selection End</span> or pressing <span class="key">Ctrl+]</span> scrolls as needed to make the selection end visible.
</ul>
