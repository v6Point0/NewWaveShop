<h3>Bit-perfect</h3>

<p>The philosophy of <em>bit-perfect</em> editing can be summarized as "don't touch the bits unless you have to." More formally, a bit-perfect editor passes the round-trip test, which is: open a document, and without changing anything, save it as a different name, and then use a binary comparison tool to verify that the copy is identical to the original. WaveShop passes the round-trip test, and care has been taken to ensure that edits are as non-destructive as possible, meaning that if a subset of an audio file is edited, the remainder is untouched. This makes WaveShop ideal for patching finished masters and similar work.

<p>The following editing commands either don't alter the samples, or do so in a way that's entirely reversible:
<ul>
<li><a href="../Edit_menu/Clipboard.htm">Clipboard</a> commands
<li><a href="../Audio_menu/Reverse.htm">Reverse</a>
<li><a href="../Audio_menu/Invert.htm">Invert</a>
<li><a href="../Audio_menu/Format.htm">Format</a> (depending on the operation)
</ul>
