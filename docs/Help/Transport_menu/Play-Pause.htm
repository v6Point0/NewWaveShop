<h3>Play/Pause</h3>

<p>This command toggles audio playback between the playing and paused states. Playing starts or resumes playback from the <a href="../Navigation/Audio_cursor.htm">audio cursor</a> position. Pausing is similar to <a href="../Transport_menu/Stop.htm">stopping</a> except that the audio isn't <a href="../Transport_menu/Rewind.htm">rewound</a>. The keyboard <a href="../Loose_ends/Shortcuts.htm">shortcut</a> for Play/Pause is the <span class="key">Space</span> bar.

<p>Note that only one document can be played at a time. To play a different document, you must first pause the currently playing document if any. However it's not necessary to activate (i.e. switch to) the playing document in order to pause it, because pause always affects the playing document, whether it's active or not. To play a different document:

<ol>
<li>Activate the desired document, by left-clicking its caption bar, or via the <a href="../Window_menu/Window_menu.htm">Window menu</a>.
<li>If no document is currently playing, press the <span class="key">Space</span> bar once to play the active document. If a different document <em>is</em> playing, press the <span class="key">Space</span> bar <em>twice</em>: once to pause the other document, and once to play the active document.
</ol>

<p>Playback can be <a href="../Transport_menu/Loop.htm">looped</a>. Volume and pitch are controlled via the <a href="../View_menu/Volume_bar.htm">volume bar</a> and <a href="../View_menu/Pitch_bar.htm">pitch bar</a> respectively. It's not necessary to pause before making an edit, because all editing commands automatically pause and resume playback if needed.
