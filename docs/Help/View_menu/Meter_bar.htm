<h3>Meter bar</h3>

<p>This bar displays peak meters for the current document. Surround audio is fully supported by giving each channel its own meter. If there are too many meters to fit, widen the bar, or horizontally scroll the meters. The meters are only active while audio is <a href="../Transport_menu/Play-Pause.htm">playing</a>, and only represent WaveShop's output, not your entire system's output. To show or hide the bar, use <span class="cmd">View/More Bars/Meter Bar</span>. The meters have clip indicators, with <a href="../Options/Audio/Meter_clip_threshold.htm">adjustable</a> sensitivity.
