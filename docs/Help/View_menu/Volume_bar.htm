<h3>Volume bar</h3>

<p>The volume bar contains a slider that controls WaveShop's playback volume. This slider only affects audio output from the current instance of WaveShop, and is distinct from the Windows volume control, or the equivalent control provided by your audio driver. The volume bar also includes a mute button, which lets you temporarily silence WaveShop without losing your volume setting. To show or hide the bar, use <span class="cmd">View/More Bars/Volume Bar</span>.
