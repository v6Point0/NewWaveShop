<h3>Channel bar</h3>

<p>The channel bar is located on the left side of the view. It contains the <em>channel rulers</em>, which are vertical rulers for measuring and <a href="../Navigation/Zooming_amplitude.htm">zooming amplitude</a>. Each channel has its own channel ruler. The channels are normally vertically synchronized, but it's also possible to make them <a href="../Options/View/Vertically_sync_channels.htm">vertically independent</a>. To show or hide the bar, use <span class="cmd">View/More Bars/Channel Bar</span>.
