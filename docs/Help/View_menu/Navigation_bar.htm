<h3>Navigation bar</h3>

<p>The navigation bar displays the <a href="../Navigation/Audio_cursor.htm">audio cursor</a> and the <a href="../Navigation/Selecting_audio.htm">selection</a> as numbers, and lets you edit them. Values are displayed in the current <a href="../Navigation/Time_format.htm">time format</a>. The selection is normally shown as a starting and ending position, but it can also be shown as a starting position and a length, by pressing the Show Length button at the far right of the navigation bar.

<p>To modify a value, left-click in its edit box, edit the existing value or type a new one, and press <span class="key">Enter</span> or <span class="key">Tab</span>. Once the navigation bar has focus, you can switch between its edit boxes via <span class="key">Tab</span> and <span class="key">Shift+Tab</span>. You can also use <span class="key">F6</span> to toggle between the view and the navigation bar. To show or hide the bar, use <span class="cmd">View/More Bars/Navigation Bar</span>.
