<h3>Spectrum bar</h3>

<p>This bar is a real-time spectrum analyzer. It calculates the frequency spectrum of the currently <a href="../Transport_menu/Play-Pause.htm">playing</a> audio, and displays the result as a dynamically updated plot in which the horizontal axis is frequency in Hertz, and the vertical axis is amplitude in decibels. To show or hide the bar, use <span class="cmd">View/More Bars/Spectrum Bar</span>. For static analysis, use the <a href="../Audio_menu/Spectrum.htm">spectrum</a> command (<span class="cmd">Audio/Spectrum</span>) instead.

<p>The real-time analyzer's behavior and appearance are configurable, via the <a href="../Options/Spectrum/Window_function.htm">parameters</a> on the Spectrum page of the options dialog. Some of these parameters are also accessible from the spectrum bar's context menu. The real-time analyzer supports various <a href="../Options/Spectrum/Plot_style.htm">plot styles</a>, and can optionally <a href="../Options/Spectrum/Show_peaks.htm">show peaks</a>. Note that while the real-time and static analyzers have similar parameters, they're completely independent of each other and can be configured differently.
