<h3>Undo/Redo</h3>

<p>Any operation that modifies the document can be undone via <span class="cmd">Edit/Undo</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+Z</span>, and redone via <span class="cmd">Edit/Redo</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+Y</span>. Undo is unlimited by default, but it can also be limited to a specific number of <a href="../Options/Edit/Undo_levels.htm">levels</a>. Each document has its own list of previous states, or undo <em>history</em>, and these histories can become large, particularly when big files are edited. Consequently undo states are stored on disk by default, though they can alternatively be stored in memory to improve performance; see <a href="../Options/Edit/Disk_threshold.htm">disk threshold</a>. The undo history can be viewed and traversed via the <a href="../View_menu/History_bar.htm">history bar</a>.
