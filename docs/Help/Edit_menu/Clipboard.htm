<h3>Clipboard</h3>

<p>The clipboard is the destination for <a href="../Edit_menu/Cut.htm">cut</a> and <a href="../Edit_menu/Copy.htm">copy</a>, and the source for <a href="../Edit_menu/Paste.htm">paste</a>. WaveShop has a private clipboard, which differs from the Windows clipboard. WaveShop's clipboard is only accessible to the current instance of WaveShop, and can't be used to share audio with other applications. It's also non-persistent, meaning its contents disappear when WaveShop exits. It's stored on disk by default; see <a href="../Options/Edit/Disk_threshold.htm">disk threshold</a>.
