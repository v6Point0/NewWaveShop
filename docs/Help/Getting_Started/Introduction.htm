<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>WaveShop is a free, open-source audio editor for Windows XP/Vista/7/8. Unlike many similar apps, WaveShop is <a href="../Loose_ends/Bit-perfect.htm">bit-perfect</a>, meaning samples aren't altered unless they need to be. Editing a portion of an audio file only affects that portion; the rest of the file is untouched. Blocks of audio can be cut and pasted without changing their contents at all. This is especially useful for patching a finished master without corrupting its dither.
